# Sound Files Directory

Place your MP3 sound files in this directory. They will be installed to `~/.claude/sounds/` and played randomly when Claude Code triggers notifications.

## Example Sound Collections

- **Warcraft 3**: Peon/Peasant voice lines
- **StarCraft**: SCV/Probe/Drone quotes
- **Portal**: GLaDOS or Wheatley
- **Custom**: Any MP3 files you want

The install script will copy all MP3 files from this directory to your Claude sounds folder.
